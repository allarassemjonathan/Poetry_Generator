## Theory and mathematical intuition
Learn the distribution of sequences of words through a Monte Carlo method. Throw the dice and randomly select sequences of words to generate text based on their probability of occurence.<br> I am working on ways to give a score for plagiarism in order to assess how much of the content is copy pasted and how much is creative work. There is still a lot of work remaining but I already have ideas to improve both the quality and the amount of plagiarism in the poems.<br> I am also working on rhymes and already have the outline of a solution. I just need to code it. 

## Sample of computer generated poem

To love is to share to listen and care in tender affectionate ways <br>
To you  <br>
I give the whole me  <br>
For  <br>
I believe that you're my destiny.  <br>
<br>
To you<br>
I felt it is not your comprehension<br>
Of the world or what's above<br>
It is your soft body felt like a winter rose<br>
Oh so soft as one can be softness that was never earlier felt by me<br><br>
I drank wine every time<br>
I kissed the bosom of thee it was the time in utter silence<br>
T'is all of the pain. <br>
When<br>
I am looking into your eyes<br>
I see your love for me is unconditional. <br>
Your skin your voice your body and your pride.<br><br>
Then<br>
I worry that if<br>
I continue to stay.<br>
Will it be wrong and will<br>
I be in your life.<br>
We will both discover.<br>
