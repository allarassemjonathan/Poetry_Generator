# Shakespeare

Learn the distribution of sequences of words through a Monte Carlo method. Throw the dice and randomly select sequences of words to generate text. I am working on ways to give a score for plagiarism in order to assess how much of the content is copy pasted and how much is creative work.
There is still a lot of work remaining but I already have ideas to improve both the quality and the amount of plagiarism in the poems. I am also working on rhymes and already have the outline of a solution. I just need to code it. 


To love is to share to listen and care in tender affectionate ways .
To you
I give the whole me
For
I believe that you're my destiny .
To you
I felt it is not your comprehension
Of the world or what's above
It is your soft body felt like a winter rose
Oh so soft as one can be softness that was never earlier felt by me
I drank wine every time
I kissed the bosom of thee it was the time in utter silence
T'is all of the pain .
When
I am looking into your eyes
I see your love for me is unconditional .
Your skin your voice your body and your pride .
Then
I worry that if
I continue to stay .
Will it be wrong and will
I be in your life .
We will both discover .
